The matplotlib documentation 
https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.html
provides the following example code
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for plotting
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(t, s)

ax.set(xlabel='time (s)', ylabel='voltage (mV)',
       title='About as simple as it gets, folks')
ax.grid()

fig.savefig("test.png")
plt.show()

to produce the following plot

The exact same plot can be produced with the following code
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)
plt.plot(t,s)
plt.grid(True)
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('voltage (mV)')
plt.title('About as simple as it gets, folks')
plt.savefig("test.png")
plt.show()

which makes no use of subplot, ax, or fig.
I learned how to plot using the second approach. I've stumbled upon the first approach only recently
and although I can kind of imagine what it's doing, it does seem far less intuitive than the second approach.
Can somebody explain the rational behind the first approach as it seems to complicate something very simple?
