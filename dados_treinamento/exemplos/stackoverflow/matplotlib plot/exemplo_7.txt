I'm encountering an issue when trying to plot a simple graph using Matplotlib in Python while in debug mode in VSCode. The plot works perfectly in normal execution mode, but when I set a breakpoint and run the code in debug mode, the plot window becomes unresponsive.
Example Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]

# Plotting the data
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sample Plot')
plt.xlabel('x-axis')
plt.ylabel('y-axis')

# Show plot
plt.show()

In normal execution mode, the plot window appears and is responsive.
In debug mode with a breakpoint, the plot window appears but becomes unresponsive and eventually throws a "not responding" error.

I tried using different Matplotlib backends, but none of them resolved the issue.
I expect to be able to plot graphs using Matplotlib in debug mode vscode without the plot window becoming unresponsive.
