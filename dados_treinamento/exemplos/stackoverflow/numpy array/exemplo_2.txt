I am trying to predict LSDC from MRI images. For each study_id there are multiple images. Each study_id represents each patient. I want to predict 3 level of severity for 5 conditions on 5 levels.
I am trying to create dataset using custom data generator using Sequence class from tensorflow.
Here is my Datagenerator class:
 class CustomDataGenerator(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, image_dict, num_img, labels_dict=None, batch_size=8, image_size=(224, 224), shuffle=True):
       self.image_dict = image_dict
       self.labels_dict = labels_dict
       self.batch_size = batch_size
       self.image_size = image_size
       self.shuffle = shuffle
       self.ids = list(image_dict.keys())
       self.num_img = num_img
       self.on_epoch_end()

    def __len__(self):
       return int(np.floor(len(self.ids) / self.batch_size))

    def __getitem__(self, index):
       start = index * self.batch_size
       end = min((index + 1) * self.batch_size, len(self.ids))
       batch_ids = self.ids[start:end]
       batch_images = []
       batch_labels = []

       for id_ in batch_ids:
           images = []

           for image_path in self.image_dict.get(id_, []):
               dicomdata = pydicom.dcmread(image_path)
               image = dicomdata.pixel_array
               image = cv2.resize(image, self.image_size)
               image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=-1)
               image = image.astype('float32') / np.max(image)
               image = np.repeat(image, 3, axis=-1)
               images.append(image)

           images = np.array(images)

           if len(images) < self.num_img:
               pad_amount = self.num_img - len(images)
               padding = [(0, pad_amount)] + [(0, 0)] * (len(images.shape) - 1)
               images = np.pad(images, padding, mode='constant')

           batch_images.append(images)

           if self.labels_dict:
               label = np.array(self.labels_dict.get(id_), dtype=np.float32)
               batch_labels.append(label)

       batch_images = np.stack(batch_images)
       if self.labels_dict:
           batch_labels = np.array(batch_labels, dtype=np.float32)
           return batch_images, batch_labels

       return batch_images

    def on_epoch_end(self):
       if self.shuffle:
           np.random.shuffle(self.ids)

My labels dictionary is as follows:
    for i, sid in enumerate(train_df['study_id']):
        labels_dict[str(sid)] = []
        for con in conditions:
            if train_df.loc[i, con] == 'normal_mild':
                labels_dict[str(sid)].append([1, 0, 0])
            elif train_df.loc[i, con] == 'severe':
                labels_dict[str(sid)].append([0, 0, 1])
            else:
                labels_dict[str(sid)].append([0, 1, 0])

       labels_dict[str(sid)] = np.array(labels_dict[str(sid)], dtype=np.float32)

I have tried various ways to convert labels_dict to numpy array. But either at the time of training it shows shape mismatch error. Or when trying to see the data it showed error.
This is the error it shows:
----> 1 model.fit(train_generator, epochs=2) #, steps_per_epoch=len(train_generator)//8)

/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/keras/src/utils/traceback_utils.py in error_handler(*args, **kwargs)
    120             # To get the full stack trace, call:
    121             # `keras.config.disable_traceback_filtering()`
--> 122             raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None
    123         finally:
    124             del filtered_tb

<ipython-input-12-cf42609bddda> in __getitem__(self, index)
     47         batch_images = np.stack(batch_images)
     48         if self.labels_dict:
---> 49             batch_labels = np.array(batch_labels, dtype=np.float32)
     50             return batch_images, batch_labels
     51 

ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (8,) + inhomogeneous part.

I tried using np.stack or batch_labels = batch_labels.reshape((batch_labels.shape[0], len(conditions), 3)), but it shows different error. My data does not have any nan and all labels_dict is of shape (batch_size, num_of_condition, severity_class). Even when I tried printing the data from generator. Generator data shape from data_x, data_y = next(iter(train_generator)) show desired shape of data for model input and output. I cannot figure out the problem.

What's the shape (or len) of each element in batch_labels?  Verify the dtype as well. This 'inhomogeneous' error tells us that something does not match, and it cannot make a regular float array.

Does the stack error tell you/us any more about the problem?

@hpaulj each element in batch_labelscontains a lists of lists. Shape of that is (8,25,3). Here 8 is batch size, 25 is number of conditions and 3 is the severity level. So basically each element is like [[[1,0,0]*25]*8]. Confusing thing is when I printed elements from train_generator by calling next(iter(train_generator)) there was no nan values in there.

@hpaulj When I used np.stack() it was just before returning the labels and images. Befor the np.stack, I converted the labels list to np.array. At that time it was showing this conversion cannot be done and due to shape or value problem.

Why the talk of nan values?  The error is about shapes.

A list arrays of differing sizes will produce your error message:
In [8]: alist = [np.array([1,2]), np.array([3,4]), np.array([5,6,7])]

In [9]: alist
Out[9]: [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4]), array([5, 6, 7])]

In [10]: np.array(alist)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[10], line 1
----> 1 np.array(alist)

ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (3,) + inhomogeneous part.

stack applied to the same list produces a different message:
In [11]: np.stack(alist)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[11], line 1
----> 1 np.stack(alist)

File ~\miniconda3\envs\mypy\Lib\site-packages\numpy\_core\shape_base.py:460, in stack(arrays, axis, out, dtype, casting)
    458 shapes = {arr.shape for arr in arrays}
    459 if len(shapes) != 1:
--> 460     raise ValueError('all input arrays must have the same shape')
    462 result_ndim = arrays[0].ndim + 1
    463 axis = normalize_axis_index(axis, result_ndim)

ValueError: all input arrays must have the same shape

Applied to a correct list:
In [12]: alist = [np.array([1,2]), np.array([3,4]), np.array([5,6])]

In [13]: np.array(alist)
Out[13]: 
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [5, 6]])

In [14]: np.stack(alist)
Out[14]: 
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [5, 6]])

If the number of conditions is variable, your batch_labels list could be something like
In [16]: alist = [np.array([]), np.array([[1,2]]), np.array([[3,4],[5,6]])]

In [17]: alist
Out[17]: 
[array([], dtype=float64),   # 0 conditions
 array([[1, 2]]),            # 1
 array([[3, 4],              # 2 conditions
        [5, 6]])]

In [18]: [i.shape for i in alist]
Out[18]: [(0,), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

In [19]: np.array(alist)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[19], line 1
----> 1 np.array(alist)

ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (3,) + inhomogeneous part.
